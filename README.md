*An app that acts as an interval timer, so you can do a HIIT for example. HIIT stands for "High Intensity Interval Training" and it's very effective for fat loss. The app is still in development. That's why I'll be glad if someone offers their help. In this branch the 'parameters' file will be saved inside the external storage.*
